# TheFishMaster_Clone
This game is a clone of The Fish Master game with Unity. The mechanics in the game are quite simple, all you have to do is slide your fishing rod left and right and collect the fish.
The price you will earn for each different fish you collect is different.

What you can buy in the market with the money you earn from the fish you catch:

- Length: Allows you to cast your fishing rod deeper.

- Strength: Allows you to catch more fish at once with your fishing rod.

- Offline Earnings: Allows you to earn more money when you return to the game.
